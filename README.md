# Open Gwent

Open Gwent is a community-driven project that aims to create a text/widget-based version of Gwent, the popular card game from inside The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. It is built with Python and Pytorch and runs on Google Colab. It uses a program design similar to AlphaGo Zero to train its model. One eventual goal of the model is to have it be better than human players at the game. It is also open source and licensed under the MIT license.
